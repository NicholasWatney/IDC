We will use "Icarus-verilog" for the Verilog compiler and virtual machine.
We first have to install dependencies:
    % brew install autoconf
    % brew install bison

We can now download icarus-verilog:
    % brew install icarus-verilog

If you have a file, hello.v,

--- hello.v
module hello;

    initial
        begin
            $display("Hello, world!");
            $finish;
    end
endmodule
---

To compile the file, hello.v:
    % iverilog -o hello hello.v

To run the recently compiled file:
    % vvp hello
